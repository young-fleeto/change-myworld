# change-myworld
Taking charge of and making positive changes in my life through learning how to code.

I have been battling depression, addiction traits, and untreated adhd for (at least) a few years. In the past 6 years since immigrating to the USA, I have lost jobs, i have many failed attempts at a career change and slowly over time my motivation (for anything really) has eroded away.
But i havent quit. Not because i think i am 'special' or 'worth-it' or even 'capable' (i mean the evidence thus far (w)could suggest the opposite) But i havent quit yet because i know that there is a solution(s) to every problem.
Put it this way; i am a person with many bugs. One solution may not fix them all or even with immediate effect, but there are solutions. Even if that solution is making my bed in the morning, so i start my day having already accomplished something.

One thing I know, I need help! And I have joined GitHub and Stack-Overflow so i can immerse myself with the culture and people who can help guide me.
If you are/were/will be a beginner that has no college degree, hated any studying, types (slowly) with their index fingers and a bunch more obstacles in their way then come say 'wits-happnin' (Glasgow/scottish for 'hello dear acquaintance, how are you?') and even if youre a super-human-coding-machine youre welcome too!
More code More solutions.
